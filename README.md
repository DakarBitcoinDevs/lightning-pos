Lightning Point-of-Sale Terminal
================================================================

This project is based on the
[OpenNode Tutorial](https://github.com/arcbtc/bitcoin2019conf)
developed by arcbtc.

The goal of this project is to build an inexpensive open source
point-of-sale terminal for lightning network payments.  The current
design connects to OpenNode's API and presents invoices on demand.
Connecting to BTCPay servers is in development.

The unit is designed to be attached to a wall or used standalone on a
counter.  It contains an internal battery and can operate for many
hours on battery power.  It requires a WiFi network to connect to the
invoice api.

The current software supports three "presets" for commonly purchased
item descriptions and prices and an "other" item with a dynamically
specified price.

The [Parts List](parts-list.md) describes all needed parts.

The case can be 3D printed from the provided STL files.
