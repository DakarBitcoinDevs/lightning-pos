Lightning Point-of-Sale Terminal
================================================================

This project builds on the
[OpenNode Tutorial](https://github.com/arcbtc/bitcoin2019conf)
developed by arcbtc. Please refer to the tutorial for hardware and IDE
setup.

*IMPORTANT* - I've moved the keypad connector down one pin to enable
the letter (4th) column.  Please see the keymatrix pin map at the top
of lightning-pos.ino.

To configure the PoS terminal please copy config.h.template to
config.h and edit as appropriate for your situation.
